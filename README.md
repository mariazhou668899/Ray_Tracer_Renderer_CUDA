# Ray_Tracer_Renderer_CUDA
This is a small ray tracer renderer system using CUDA. 
This Ray Tracing System uses a custom data type Vec3 as a basic data to support constructing camera and ray, and to represent a location point in space and color. System gets the results of the surface normal by calculating the point of contact between the ray and an object. From there, it uses a model called Phong shading model to do the coloring for every pixel of the surface and get a snapshot. The x, y, z of snapshotsâ€™ points are transformed into PPM format and is stored as a PPM file for viewing. Each PPM file is a frame corresponding to a snapshot. Besides, it renders multiple frames to simulate an animated scene, including the light surrounding on the surface of 3 spheres and the cube moving along Y axis. The rendering process has been accelerated on GPU by CUDA, allowing massive parallelism in the rendering process and ultimately cutting down on the long rendering time.
